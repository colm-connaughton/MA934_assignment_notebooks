    "\n",
    "The file KVPair.jl defines a simple data structure to represent an (Int64, Float64) key-value pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file LList.jl defines a linked list that stores a KVPair at each node. Many languages have a keyword NULL. A pointer to any object can take the value NULL to indicate that it doesn't point to anything. NULL is often used to denote the end of a list, the leaves of a tree etc. Julia does not support NULL pointers. This causes a difficulty in implementing recursive data structures. Instead Julia provides a parametric data type Nullable{T} to represent missing values. It is possible to use Nullable types to define recursive data structures although some of the resulting definitions are a bit clumsy. I'm not sure that this is the canonical way to implement structural recursion in Julia. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following points are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if a variable has type Nullable{T} then it can either contain a value of type T or nothing (ie a missing value). \n",
    "* the function isnull(x) checks whether a nullable type x has a value or not. \n",
    "* the function get(x) returns the actual value (of type T) contained in a nullable type x.\n",

    "2. Write a function search(list::Nullable{LList}, k::Int64) that searches an LList for the key k and returns the corresponding KVPair if it is present and a Nullable{KVPair} otherwise. Verify that your function works.\n",

    "## Question 3: Gillespie algorithm for heterogeneous diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gillespie algorithm is a dynamic Monte Carlo algorithm that generates statistically correct realisations of a continous time Markov process. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm It is used heavily in stochastic simulation of chemical and biological reaction networks and population dynamics. In this question we use it to simulate one-dimensional diffusion of heterogeneous particles whose diffusion constants are independently drawn from an exponential distribution.\n",

    "1. Create a list $\\left\\{(i, r_i), i=1,\\ldots M\\right\\}$,  of all possible transitions (events), $i$, that can occur in the system and the corresponding transition rates, $r_i$.\n",
    "2. Calculate the total rate\n",
    "$$R = \\sum_{i=1}^M r_i$$\n",
    "and divide the interval $[0, R]$ into $M$ intervals whose lengths are given by the $r_i$.\n",
    "3. Generate a uniform random number in the range $[0,R]$ and determine which interval it falls in. \n",
    "4. Perform the corresponding transition and update the time variable by an amount $\\Delta t = 1/R$.\n",
    "5. Repeat until the desired simulation time is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be concrete, suppose with have $N$ particles on the interval $[-L, L]$ initially located at $x=0$. Each particle can hop a distance $\\Delta x$ to the left or to the right with equal probability. The rate of hopping is initially considered to be the same for all particles:\n",

    "\n",
    "The steps of the algorithm then correspond to the following:\n",
    "1. There are $M= 2 N$ possible transitions at each step: each of $N$ particles can hop a distance $\\Delta x$ either left or right with the above rates. We index them as follows: events k=1:N correspond to particle k hopping to the right, events k=N+1:2N correspond to particle k-N hopping to the left.\n",
    "2. The total rate is \n",
    "$$ R = \\frac{D N}{(\\Delta x)^2}.$$\n",
    "3. Generate a uniform random number in the range $[0,R]$ and determine the index $k$ of particle to move and the direction.\n",
    "4. Update the position of particle $k$ accordingly.\n",
    "5. Repeat.\n",
